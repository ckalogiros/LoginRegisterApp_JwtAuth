JWT: Json Web Tokens

consists of three parts

Headers: 
    Tells the server what type of signature is being used
    {
        "alg": "HS256",
        "typ": "JWT"
    }

Payload:
    Used to identify the user (e.x. contains user id, NO sensitive data must be included)
    {
        "sub": "1234567890",
        "name": "John Doe",
        "iat": 1516239022
    }

Signature:
    Makes the token secure(hashes the header and payload to create a signature
        and uses secret key in server side that is the key to verify 
        the token and therefore the authenticity of the user)
    HMACSHA256(
        base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
        base64UrlEncode(payload),
    ) secret base64 encoded


The JWT token is stored to the front end as a cookie 
and is passed to the server on every GET request.
